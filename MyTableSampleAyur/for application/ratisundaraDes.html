      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vasthi is the ace amongst all Panchakarma treatments. In simple terms, vasthi means medicated enema.
	   After the pre operative procedures, the medicinal preparation is introduced into the bowel through the anus.
	    It takes just about 5 minutes for this, but the patient has to retain it for at least another 15 minutes before
		 expelling it out.<BR/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medicine pulls out the toxins from the entire body channels into the bowels, which are then expelled out of the body.<BR/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vasthi should be done only under the strict guidance of doctors. The periodicity of enema, the retention time, the type and 
amount of medicines used, food habits etc. varies from person to person. The usual recommended course is 3 or 5 vasthi. <BR/>
<BR/>
<B><U>Indication</B></U><BR/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It alleviates constipation, distention, chronic fever, the common cold, sexual disorders, kidney stones, piles, backache,
 and hyper acidity. Rheumatoid and gouty arthritis are also treated by vasthi. <BR/>
<BR/>
<B><U>Preparation</B></U><BR/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honey, rock salt, herbal pastes, oils, and decoctions are the main ingredients of the preparation used for vasthi.
 The decoctions used in Vasthi are good toxin eliminators. Dill seed used for making the herbal paste is a pain and inflammatory 
 reducer. The rock salt increases penetration and honey helps in spreading the medicines faster in the bowels.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B><U>Benefits</B></U><BR/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since medicines reach your bowels directly without enzymatic actions, its effectiveness is very high. Hence, vasthi is also
 done along with many other Ayurvedic treatments. Due to its potential healing ability, vasthi is considered as "half the treatment",
  for many of these types of diseases. It washes out all your toxins through the digestive tract. As a rejuvenating health treatment,
   vasthi imparts high immunity and longevity, reduces degeneration of tissues, and prevents ageing.
