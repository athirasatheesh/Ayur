      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kateevasthi is done by retaining certain amount of warm medicated oil on the low back of the body.  
	  The person is preconditioned by applying warm oil on his head. Then he lies comfortably on the treatment table
	   face down. Black gram paste, is thickly applied around the affected part (low back), to retain the oil for 
	   prolonged period. Into this, warm oil is poured to a height of 1 to 2 inches. The oil heat is ensured to be 
	   constant throughout the process. For this, the used oil is periodically replaced with fresh, warm oil.
