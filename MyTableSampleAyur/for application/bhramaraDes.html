      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thailadhara is a continuous showering and massaging process of the whole body with warm medicated oil. Preconditioning 
	  of the body is the first stage of Thailadhara. It involves the smearing of the whole body with warm oil. This makes the
	   body muscles loose, and enables active functioning of the medicines. The next step is to allow the person to sit on the
	    wooden treatment table. Warm oil is then poured through nosed vessels, on to the body, non stop for nearly an hour. 
		This is usually done by 2 or more trained therapists. <BR/>
