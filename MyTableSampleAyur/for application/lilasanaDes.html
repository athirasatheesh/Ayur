	   preparatory methods before Panchakarma. No other medicines, except the ghee, are taken during the treatment.
	    Strict diet pattern has to be followed as per the doctor's advice. After snehapanam, purgation is strongly recommended<BR/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghee lubricates all the channels of the body, including the lymph, and forces out the toxins from them, into the digestive tract.
 It also calms down the mind and reduces mental stress. As a result, the body immunity increases, the effects of the ailments 
 subside and frequent recurrence of the disease is prevented. It also increases the person's appetite level and accelerates 
 peristaltic movements of the intestine.
