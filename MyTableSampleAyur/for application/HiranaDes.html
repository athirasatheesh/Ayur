      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tissue-nourishing treatment, using highly nutritious rice called 'Njavara' 
	  The person is first preconditioned by applying mild oil on the body and head, and is made to
	   lie down relaxingly. Warm 'Njavara' rice, cooked with herbal decoction and milk, 
	   is squeezed out through a cotton pouch and massaged on to the whole body of the person. 
	   This continues for about 30 to 40 minutes until the whole preparation is evenly spread on the body. 
	   As soon as the rice spread looses its warmth, it is completely wiped off and warm oil is applied on the body. 
	   The person lies idle for another 30 minutes before he goes for a warm refreshing shower.<BR/>
